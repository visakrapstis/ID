Project Description: The goal is developing a personal assistant chatbot using Python and Streamlit UI. Adding additional functionality to perform various tasks, including switching to local and cloud LLMs, Prompt Engineering, creating Python files, and executing Python code just to make a personal workflow more fluent.

Please NOTE: to use a local LLM, additional download (exc. on ollama.com) is required. For a LLM through Groq-cloud, API key must be set as system variable (https://groq.com/groqcloud/)
