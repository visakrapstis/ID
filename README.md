# About me in short

Until recently, I was working as a Surgeon Germany. I am very glad to have collected lots of experience from very good workplaces, inc. Mannheim and Ulm University hospitals. 
As long as my medical career lasted, I was showing interest and involving myself in various research activities. 
Though since a couple of years, I noticed growing attraction to Data-Sciences, so I decide to dive in with a first step being the Data-Science Intensive course.
As for now my focus fully shifts to Data Sciences, Deep Learning and Artificial Intelligence.

# Some recent projects
### 1. A medicine diagnostic tool trained on neuronal networks

[Medical diagnostics in streamlit](https://github.com/visakrapstis/ID/tree/main/medical_diagnostics)
To look at the potential of the technology in the field of Medicine

### 2. A personal coder using local LLM / Groq

[Personal universal assistant](https://github.com/visakrapstis/ID/tree/main/personal%20assistant)
My personal assistant using various llms, prompt engineering and adding various extra functionality for a frictionless workflow

### 3. A simple Agent using Langchain framework

[Personal Agent](https://github.com/visakrapstis/ID/tree/main/agent%20with%20tools)
Exploring the power of LLMs with tools (python, local RAG, web search and more!)
