# About me in short

Until recently, I was working as a Surgeon in visceral Surgery, Germany. I am very glad to have collected lots of experience from very good workplaces, inc. Mannheim and Ulm University hospitals. 
As long as the medical career in Germany lasted, I was showing interest and involving myself in various research activities. 

From a couple of years, I have a growing attraction to Data-Sciences as I begin to notice how much importance IT, Datasets, Data Analysis, Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence win over years on the broader stage, 
and I begin to understand the value of it in the future, especially in medicine. 
So after the Graduation of Specialty at Ulm University Hospital, I decided to take a very close look at these Sciences and continue the Career with Data-Science Intensive course.

# Some reasant projects
### 1. A powerfull medicine diagnostic tool trained on neuronal networks

[Medical diagnostics in streamlit](https://github.com/visakrapstis/ID/tree/main/medical_diagnostics)
To look at the potential of the technology in the field of Medicine

### 2. A personal coder using local LLM / Groq
