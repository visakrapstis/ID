
Loop colostomy
This is used to divert the faecal stream. The most commonly selected sites
are the transverse and sigmoid colon. Transverse colostomy
should be avoided if an alternative is possible as it is prone to many
complications.

Indications
• In patients with distal colonic obstruction as first part of a staged
resection.
• As palliation for unresectable lesions.
• To defunction distal anastomosis.
• To protect anal operations, e.g. anal fistula or sphincter repair.

Procedure
A formal laparotomy may not be needed.
• WHO checklist.
• For a transverse colostomy, make a horizontal incision midway
between the umbilicus and the costal margin in the right upper
quadrant.
• Incise all the layers of the abdominal wall. Divide the muscle fibres
of the rectus abdominis.
• Mobilize the transverse colon from omental adhesions. Preserve the
marginal vasculature.
• Make a window close to the bowel in the transverse mesocolon. Pass
a nylon tape through the window. Use this to bring the loop to the
surface.
• Replace the tape with a rod. The latter supports the loop.
• Attach the bowel to the anterior rectus sheath with interrupted
absorbable sutures.
• If a midline incision has been made close and cover it.
• Open the colon longitudinally. Suture the margin of the open colon to
the adjacent skin edge with interrupted absorbable sutures.
• An appropriate sized hole is cut in the stoma bag to accommodate
the rod and the looped colon.
