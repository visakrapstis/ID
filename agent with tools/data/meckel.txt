Meckel

Excision of Meckel’s diverticulum
Indications
• Acute inflammation.
• Bleeding from ectopic gastric mucosa.
• Intestinal obstruction—volvulus around a persistent band or
adhesion, intussusception.
• An incidental finding at laparotomy. Consider excision because of the
risk of associated pathology. A wide-mouthed, thin-walled unattached
diverticulum in an adult patient may be left alone.

Procedure
The choice is between either diverticulectomy or excision of the segment
of ileum carrying the diverticulum.
• WHO checklist.
• Isolate the segment of ileum containing the diverticulum. Ligate any
supplying vessels.
• Apply light occlusion clamps to the ileum and divide the diverticulum
at its base and close the bowel wall transversely. The
diverticulum can also be removed by a single firing of a transverse
stapler.
• Resect the segment of ileum in patients with peptic ulceration or
diverticulitis affecting the base.
• Restore intestinal continuity by a single- or two-layer anastomosis.
