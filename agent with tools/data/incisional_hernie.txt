
Incisional hernia repair
Procedure
Open repair
• Excise the old scar.
• The skin may be fused to the peritoneum—if so, excise an ellipse of
skin to reveal the subcutaneous tissue.
• The incision needs to be deepened down to the rectus sheath and a
margin around the defect created.
• Invert the sac—it may need to be opened if narrow necked to reduce
the contents. Close the sac if you have opened it.
• For multiple incisional hernias join the defects to give you just one
larger defect to address.
• Measure your mesh to ensure an overlap of 3–5cm at the edge of the
defect.

Mesh placement
• Onlay: place the mesh anterior to the sheath and defect—you may
not have been able to close this defect primarily. Suture it in place.
• Extra-peritoneal: create a pocket (3cm overlap) for the mesh with the
peritoneum and posterior rectus sheath below and the rectus muscle
above the mesh and suture.
• Intra-peritoneal: open the hernia sac, divide any adhesions, and clear
a 4cm space for the mesh all around the defect. Suture in place.

Closure
• Leave one or two Redivac® drains to drain the subcutaneous space.
• Fat/Scarpa’s fascia 2.0 Vicryl® interrupted.
• Skin 3.0 Monocryl®.
Laparoscopic repair of incisional hernias would follow the same principles
as described for ventral hernias. The size of the defect, however, may
preclude this method.

Tips and tricks
• Consider the use of biological mesh (Permacol®) in infected
scenarios.
• Take care to protect bowel when stitching/tacking mesh to
abdominal wall in intra-peritoneal plane.
• For preoperative counselling regarding benefits of weight loss on
morbidity and recurrence rates, use CeDAR ‘Carolinas Equation for
Determining Associated Risks’ of ventral hernia repairs—free on the
App store. Gives the patient some hard facts about the increased
morbidity associated with obesity and hernia repairs enabling you to
help them set targets preoperatively to hopefully achieve a better longterm
outcome.
