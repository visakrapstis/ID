Ventralhernie. Open repair (onlay-sublay)

Anatomy
Anterior abdominal wall.
• Muscles: rectus abdominis, external oblique, internal oblique, and
transversus abdominis from superficial to deep.
• Linea alba: avascular, midline structure from xiphoid process to
symphysis pubis.
• Rectus sheath: above the umbilicus, these form the anterior and
posterior rectus sheaths; one-third below umbilicus anterior sheath
only.
• Blood supply: superior and inferior epigastric arteries.
• Anterior cutaneous nerves T7–T12 (umbilicus level of T10).
Ventral hernias comprise any hernia of the anterior abdominal wall. They
can be spontaneous (epigastric, umbilical, paraumbilical, and spigelian)
or acquired (incisional hernias).

Indications
• Symptomatic hernia. 
• Prevent strangulation of contents.

Procedure
Open repair—the principle is the same for all types of ventral hernia:
• Incise skin → subcutaneous fat/ fascia over the hernia sac.
• Dissect the sac free, without breeching it, down to its neck at the
rectus sheath.
• Open the sac, inspect its contents/reduce if viable.
• Close sac (0/#1 Vicryl®); amputate the excess.
• Create a clear space 360° around the defect between the peritoneum
and the sheath (i.e. the preperitoneal space).
If the fascial defect is <2cm diameter:
• Perform a primary suture repair with interrupted non-absorbable 2.0
sutures.
If the fascial defect 2–4cm:
• Close the fascia with a two-layer sutured technique (non-absorbable
0).
• The upper leaf of fascia is brought down over the lower leaf by
mattress sutures and then the free edge is secured with interrupted
sutures.
For medium to large defects a mesh repair is preferred:
• Size of mesh: 3–5cm overlap of the defect.
• Siting: preperitoneal onlay, over primarily closed fascial
defect or intraperitoneal mesh.
• Intra-peritoneal mesh: dual-sided mesh—non-adherent side (ePTE®
surface) to peritoneal cavity, adherent side (Polypropylene®) against
the abdominal wall.
• Secure the mesh: non-absorbable 2.0 mattress sutures at 3, 6, 9, and
12 o’clock.
• Closure: fascia: 2.0 non-absorbable sutures, interrupted; Scarpa’s
fascia 2.0 Vicryl®; Skin 3.0 Monocryl®.
