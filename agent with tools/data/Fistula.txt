Fistula

Surgery for fistula-in-ano
Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Carried out under general anaesthetic, usually as a day-case
procedure.
• Perform rigid procto-sigmoidoscopy.
• Identify the position of the external opening (or openings). Goodsall’s
rule is helpful in predicting the direction of tract. It states
that a fistula where the external opening is situated behind the
transverse anal line has a curved tract and opens in the posterior
midline, whereas anteriorly placed openings have straight tracts with
an internal opening in the corresponding quadrant of the anal canal.
• Palpate the peri-anal skin carefully for induration. This helps to
indicate the course of the fistulous tract.
• Perform a digital examination of the anorectum to feel for the
internal opening and any supra-levator induration.
• Insert an Eisenhammer proctoscope and look for the internal
opening.
• Gently insert a Lockhart–Mummery fistula probe in the external
opening and ascertain the direction and depth of the tract.
Look for secondary tracts. Allow the tip to exit through the internal
opening. Bend the probe to bring the tip outside the anal orifice.
• Using diathermy cut onto the probe to lay open superficial, intersphincteric
and low trans-sphincteric tracts.
• Use self-retaining retractors to expose the tract. Curette the
granulation tissue away. Consider sending tissue from the tract for
histological examination.
• Cut away any overhanging skin edges. Lay open any secondary
extensions.
• When the exact position and level of the tract in relation to the
external sphincter is not clear, insert a loose Seton such as a vascular
sling or non-absorbable suture.
• Seton can similarly be used to drain acute infection secondary to a
fistula-in-ano with definitive surgery being deferred until the acute
inflammation settles.
• Lay open the tract outside the sphincters when you encounter a high
trans-sphincteric or supra-sphincteric tract. Encircle the muscle with a
Seton. Tighten it at 2-weekly intervals until it cuts through. This allows
the gradual severance of the muscle followed by fibrosis.

Tips and tricks
• Don’t force the probe—you may create a false passage.
• Look for multiple extensions and deal with them individually.
• It is possible to feel the fistula tract by palpating the peri-anal skin
with a lubricated finger.
