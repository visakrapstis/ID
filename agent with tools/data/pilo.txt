Pilonidalsinus

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Mark an island of skin, asymmetrically placed off the midline
according to whichever side is most affected by skin sinuses/previous
sepsis—the excision will need to be asymmetrical and with a ‘tear
drop’ extension on the anal end to allow for equal skin-edge lengths.
• Excise the island of skin.
• All sinuses and associated scar tissue should be identified and
cleared or excised/ablated. It is not necessary to excise tissue in the
midline down to the pre-sacral fascia.
• Elevate a flap of skin off to one side of the cleft.
• Remove the tapes if present.
• Close the natal cleft by suturing together the exposed fat from deep
to superficial in multiple levels, if necessary.
• A drain may be left for 2–3 days.
• Advance the flap across the middle of the cleft and suture in place.
• Use subcuticular monofilament sutures to oppose skin margins.

Tips and tricks
• Look for and excise secondary tracts.
• Mobilize flaps adequately to prevent tension on suture line.
