Appendektomie

Open appendicectomy

Procedure
Palpate the abdomen again with the patient anaesthetized, as it may help
to locate the position of the appendix. If a circumscribed lump or a diffuse
thickening is felt, plan the incision accordingly.
• Perform WHO checklist.
• Divide the aponeurosis of the external oblique in line with its fibres
and split the internal oblique and transversus muscles. Retract the
muscles to expose the peritoneum.
• Open the peritoneum between artery forceps. If wider access is
required, the internal oblique and transversus muscles can be divided
in line with the fibres of the external oblique. Do this medially or
laterally, as required.
• Aspirate serous exudate or frank pus and send a sample for culture
and sensitivity.
• Identify the caecum. Pick it up with fingers or Babcock’s forceps
applied to the tinea coli, and slowly and carefully draw the caecum to
the surface. If the appendix does not come into view, pass an index
finger along one of the tinea to their junction at the appendix base and
then lift it out.
• Hold up the appendix with tissue forceps applied around it. Divide
the meso-appendix with the appendicular artery between forceps and
ligate it. Identify the base of the appendix, apply artery
forceps to the base to crush it then apply again more distally. Ligate
• Pass a purse-string seromuscular suture in the caecum about 1cm
from the base of the appendix using a 3/0 absorbable suture. Divide
the appendix flush with the under-surface of the artery forceps. Place
the appendix and the instruments in a dirty dish taking care during
and after division not to soil the wound or the peritoneum.
• Invaginate the stump and tie the purse-string suture. If the caecal
wall is oedematous and friable, this is not necessary.
