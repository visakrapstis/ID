
Laparoscopic loop ileostomy
Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Create pneumoperitoneum using Hasson technique at umbilicus.
• A 5mm suprapubic working port is placed under vision.
• The table can be tilted head-down and left lateral position to
facilitate visualizing the caecum.
• Identify the ileo-caecal junction and work proximally up the small
bowel using atraumatic grasping forceps to identify a convenient loop
of terminal ileum that can be brought out easily and without tension.
Orientate this loop carefully under vision so that the proximal bowel
lies superiorly with the ileal mesentery lying in a cephalad direction.
• Make an open trephine by excising a circular area of skin over the
marked stoma site. Ensure that the trephine admits two fingers to
ensure there will be no obstruction to the blood supply of the bowel.
• Excise subcutaneous fat to expose the anterior rectal sheath. Make a
cruciate incision on the sheath and use artery forceps to split the
rectus abdominis muscle. Do this carefully to avoid injury to the
inferior epigastric vessels.
• Expose the peritoneum by retracting the split muscle.
• Before opening the peritoneum, grasp the loop of ileum
laparoscopically and hold up to the surface just away from the
trephine.
• Open the peritoneum between artery forceps and immediately grasp
and deliver the ileal loop through the trephine incision with Babcock
forceps.
• Remove carbon dioxide and withdraw the ports.
• Close fascia of 10mm port sites.
• Subcuticular sutures or steristrips to approximate skin.
• Infiltrate wounds with local anaesthetic and dress the wounds.
• Continue with fashioning the loop ileostomy as for an open
procedure.

Tips and tricks
• Aim to create 3cm spout for good function (prevent skin excoriation).

Closure of loop ileostomy
Indication
When faecal stream diversion is no longer required.

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Insert four muco-cutaneous stay sutures to help in mobilization. Hold
the long ends on an artery forceps.
• Using cutting diathermy, incise the skin circumferentially close to
the muco-cutaneous junction.
• Use sharp dissection to free the ileal loops from the parieties.
• Insert a finger in the peritoneal cavity and sweep it carefully around
to separate adhesions and to allow withdrawal of sufficient length of
small bowel for anastomosis.
• Separate the loops and divide the mesentery adjacent to the site
chosen for anastomosis.
• Divide the ileum and carry out a single- or two-layered anastomosis
or a stapled functional end–end anastomosis.
• Return the segment of bowel into the peritoneal cavity.
• Close with a single layer of interrupted PDS or non-absorbable
sutures.
• Oppose the skin margins with interrupted non-absorbable sutures or
apply a purse string suture and tighten it leaving a gap in the centre.

Tips and tricks
• Check that the loops are not twisted/rotated.
• Create space for the joined bowel loop to easily return into
peritoneal cavity.
