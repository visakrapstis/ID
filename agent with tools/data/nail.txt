Surgery for ingrowing toenails
Anatomy
Ingrowing toenails, or onychocryptosis, is a common problem wherein the
nail plate punctures the corresponding periungual skin creating a foreign
body reaction that can become infected.
Indications
• Failure of conservative therapies.
• Severe pain/recurrent infections.

Procedure
• Infiltrate the local to create a ring block. Check sensation by
pinching the skin with toothed forceps.
• Apply a tourniquet around the toe.
• Partial avulsion: elevate the nail from its bed. Split the nail all the
way down to its matrix and remove.
• Phenol is applied to the nail bed for 30–60s.
• Total avulsion—the whole nail is removed + phenolization.
• Remove the tourniquet.
• Wrap the toe in a sterile bandage.
