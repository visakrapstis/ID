Laparoscopic inguinal hernia repair
Anatomy
• The triangle of pain—containing the femoral, lateral femoral
cutaneous, anterior femoral cutaneous, and the femoral branch of the
genitofemoral nerves.
• The triangle of doom—containing the external iliac vein, deep
circumflex iliac vein, and the femoral artery.

Indications
• NICE guidance: can be considered for primary unilateral and
bilateral and recurrent herniae.
Procedure—transabdominal preperitoneal (TAPP)
• 10mm supra-umbilical port; establish access and pneumoperitoneum
using the open Hasson technique.
• 2 × 5mm ports placed under direct vision in the left and right midabdomen
at the level of the umbilicus.
• Perform a diagnostic laparoscopy.
• Create a peritoneal flap from the ASIS laterally to the medial
umbilical ligament 2–3 cm above the hernia sac.
• Retract the lower peritoneal flap and use blunt dissection to open the
avascular plane between the peritoneum and the transversalis fascia.
• Carefully dissect the indirect hernia sac away from the cord
structures.
• It is important to get good medial coverage with the mesh, so ensure
you have dissected to the contralateral PT.
• Size the mesh, trim as necessary. Roll it up and place it into the
abdominal cavity through the 10mm port or use tip of graspers to hold
mesh in centre
• Tap it into the final position.
• Tack into place medially over the PT and superiorly, avoiding the
epigastric vessels.
• Lift the inferior leaf of the peritoneum to check the mesh does not
roll. Trim as necessary.
• Either tack or suture the peritoneal leaf back into place to cover the
mesh completely.
• Closure—sheath J-PDS® 1, skin 3.0 absorbable.
