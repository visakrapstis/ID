Hämorrhoiden

Injection sclerotherapy
Indications
Persistent haemorrhoidal bleeding or small anterior mucosal prolapse.
The aim of the procedure is to cause submucosal fibrosis.

Position
Left lateral.

Procedure
• Done as an outpatient procedure.
• Discuss procedure and obtain consent.
• Draw up 10–15ml of 5% phenol in almond oil into a Luer lock syringe
with a shouldered Gabriel needle.
• Pass a proctoscope and identify the left lateral, right anterior, and
right posterior internal haemorrhoids.
• Inject 3–5ml of the solution under vision into the submucosa above
each haemorrhoid. The correct plane of injection is indicated
by elevation of the mucosa.
• Review the patient at 6 weeks and repeat the procedure if necessary.

Rubber band ligation
Indication
Persistent bleeding and prolapsing haemorrhoids The aim of the
procedure is to fix the mucosa thereby preventing prolapse. This
treatment is reserved for grade II haemorrhoids.

Contraindications
Anticoagulation, immunocompromised patient.

Position
Left lateral.

Procedure
• Outpatient procedure. Discuss procedure and obtain consent.
• Pass a proctoscope and identify the internal haemorrhoids.
• Use suction banding apparatus to put a rubber band over
the mucosa of lower rectum above the haemorrhoidal tissue at 3, 7,
and 11 o’ clock positions.
• Apply suction and wait for few seconds before completely pulling the
handle of the instrument to apply the band.
• Apply two or three bands at one sitting.
• It is important to make sure, before releasing the band, that the
suction on the mucosa does not cause pain. If it does, apply the band
to a more proximal position.

Haemorrhoidectomy
Indications
• Prolapsing haemorrhoids with symptomatic external haemorrhoids
(pain, swelling).
• Second-degree haemorrhoids (reduce spontaneously) and thirddegree
haemorrhoids (needing to be reduced manually) that do not
respond to outpatient procedures.
• Fourth-degree haemorrhoids (which remain prolapsed permanently).

Procedure (Milligan–Morgan technique)
Usually done as a day-case procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Prepare the skin, towel up, and shave the perineum. Insert a bivalve
anal speculum and assess the position and size of the haemorrhoids.
Start with the most posterior lying haemorrhoid so that blood does not
obscure vision.
• Apply artery forceps to the skin at the edge of the external
haemorrhoid and incise the skin with cutting diathermy.
• Continue the dissection medially with diathermy and insert the
bivalve speculum once the anal margin is reached.
• Continue to carefully separate the internal haemorrhoidal tissue
from the white internal sphincter muscle fibres using diathermy.
• Achieve haemostasis with diathermy during this dissection.
• Divide mucosa at the apex of the haemorrhoid with diathermy or by
transfixing with 2/0 absorbable suture.
• Repeat the procedure to excise the haemorrhoids in other positions,
taking care to keep skin bridges between excisions to avoid anal
stenosis. During the operation repeatedly remove and reinsert the
speculum to avoid overstretching the sphincter.
• At the completion of the procedure an anal pack is not required.
• Stool softeners may aid postoperative pain.
• Perform digital rectal examination and proctoscopy 6 weeks after
discharge.
• The above description is of an open technique using diathermy. In
the closed technique, the skin edges and the mucosa are sutured
together.

Circular stapled haemorrhoidectomy
Another technique, where a circular stapling device is introduced peranally,
is used to excise a rim of rectal mucosa above the haemorrhoids. The result is that the prolapsed haemorrhoidal tissue is drawn
back into a more physiological position and its blood supply is interrupted. The procedure is claimed to be less painful and allows rapid
postoperative recovery.

Tips and tricks
• Haemorrhoids may coexist with other conditions like inflammatory
bowel disease or malignancy.
• Non-excisional procedures should be considered first, if appropriate.
• Choice of technique should be tailor-made to patient’s symptoms and
severity of prolapse.
• Keep skin bridges between haemorrhoids being excised and always
safeguard sphincter complex.
