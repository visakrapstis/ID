Kolostoma

End colostomy
Usually formed from the sigmoid or lower descending colon, which is
brought to the surface through a trephine in the left side of the abdominal
wall.

Indications
• After abdomino-perineal excision for distal rectal cancers and some
anal cancers.
• After a Hartmann’s procedure (potentially reversible).
• Irremediable faecal incontinence.

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• In addition to laparotomy for the major procedure, make a trephine
by excising a circular area of skin over the marked stoma site. Pick up
the skin with a Littlewood’s forceps and excise a disc of skin ˜2cm in
diameter. Alternatively make a cruciate incision and trim the edges
using a cutting diathermy point.
• Excise a disc of subcutaneous fat exposing the anterior rectal sheath.
• Make a cruciate incision on the anterior rectal sheath to expose the
rectus abdominis muscle.
• Split the rectus muscle using artery forceps gently to avoid injury to
the inferior epigastric vessels.
• Retract the muscle and open the peritoneum between artery forceps.
The aperture should allow the tips of two fingers through it.
• The divided, proximal end of the mobilized colon is brought through
the abdominal wall aperture using Babcock forceps.
• Close and cover the main wound.
• Excise the staple line and suture the skin edge to full thickness of
bowel end using interrupted 3/0 Monocryl® sutures.
