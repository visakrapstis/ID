Indications
• When faecal stream diversion is no longer required. Check for
anastomotic integrity and patency using contrast radiology and
endoscopic examination prior to reversal.
• Prepare proximal colon as for any colonic anastomosis.

Procedure
• Preoperative investigations (contrast study/colonoscopy) to rule out
distal obstruction are necessary.
• WHO checklist.
• Insert four muco-cutaneous stay sutures to help in mobilization. Hold
the long ends on an artery forceps.
• Using cutting diathermy, incise the skin close to the muco-cutaneous
junction.
• Use sharp dissection and retraction to free the colon loops from the
parieties.
• Close the colostomy transversely using one-layer interrupted
seromuscular extra-mucosal sutures.
• Replace the colon into the peritoneal cavity.
• Close the abdominal wall in one layer using interrupted PDS sutures.
Close the skin with interrupted sutures or skin staples.

Tips and tricks
• Preoperative marking is important to select appropriate site.
• Check the orientation of colon, ensure not twisted or rotated
(insufflation of air in rectum).
• Rule out distal obstruction before reversal of colostomy.
