Fissura

Conservative measures like using bulk laxatives, stool softeners, and
topical application of local anaesthetic assist in the spontaneous healing
of most acute fissures. Topical glyceryl trinitrate 0.2%, 0.4%, or Diltiazem
2% applied locally, reduces anal pressure and achieves healing in 50–70%
of all fissures. Intra-sphincteric injection of botulinum toxin (Botox) to
paralyse sphincter gives sufficient time to heal the fissure and is
successful in >70% of cases.

Lateral internal sphincterotomy
Indication
Surgery is indicated when medical therapy fails. Anal dilatation has been
abandoned in favour of lateral internal sphincterotomy because the latter procedure is more controlled and incontinence is less common.

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Perform a digital rectal examination and sigmoidoscopy.
• Introduce a bivalve anal speculum. Open it gradually to put the
fibres of the internal sphincter on the stretch.
• Ask the assistant to apply traction to peri-anal skin.
• Palpate the inter-sphincteric groove in 3 o’clock position.
• Infiltrate local anaesthetic with 1:200,000 adrenaline in the groove
and make a 1cm incision along the groove.
• The lower border of the internal sphincter is identified as a white
band. Using blunt-ended scissors develop the inter-sphincteric and
submucosal planes. Divide the internal sphincter to the level of the
dentate line.
• Excise any skin tag or hypertrophied internal papilla.
• Apply pressure to achieve haemostasis.
• Leave the wound open.
In the closed technique, insert a scalpel in the same position with the
blade parallel to the internal sphincter. Advance it along the intersphincteric
groove. Rotate the scalpel towards the internal sphincter and
divide it.
Local advancement flap of peri-anal skin may be used for recurrent
fissure after sphincterotomy and where risk to continence is high.

Tips and tricks
• Be sure of the diagnosis.
• Rule out other causes for fissure before commencing conservative
treatment.
• Be aware of potential for previous sphincter damage—anal surgery,
vaginal deliveries.
• Be aware of ‘low pressure’ fissures.
• Do not extend the division of internal sphincter above dentate line or
upper limit of fissure.
• Do not attempt sphincterotomy in presence of proctitis.
