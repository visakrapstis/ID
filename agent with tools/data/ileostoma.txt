Ileostoma

Ileostomy—formation and closure
End ileostomy
Indications
• Total colectomy and end ileostomy for ischaemic or infective colitis
like Clostridium difficile.
• Part of planned three-stage proctocolectomy for inflammatory bowel
disease (ulcerative colitis).
• Permanent ileostomy in familial adenomatous polyposis and patients
with synchronous colonic and rectal cancers.

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• In addition to laparotomy for the major procedure, make a trephine
by excising a circular area of skin over the marked stoma site. Pick up
the skin with a Littlewood’s forceps and excise a disc ˜2cm in
diameter. Alternatively, make a cruciate incision and trim the edges
using a cutting diathermy point.
• Excise a disc of subcutaneous fat to expose the anterior rectal
sheath. Make a cruciate incision on the sheath.
• Use artery forceps to split the rectus abdominis muscle. Do this
carefully to avoid injury to the inferior epigastric vessels.
• Expose the peritoneum by retracting the split muscle. Open the
peritoneum between artery forceps. The trephine must admit the tips
of two fingers to ensure there will be no obstruction to the blood
supply of the bowel.
• Divide the ileum close to the ileo-caecal junction using a linear
stapler.
• Divide the adjacent mesentery and partially remove the mesentery of
about 5cm of terminal ileum.
• Deliver this length of ileum through the trephine onto the skin
surface.
• The ileal mesentery should lie in a cephalad direction. Stitch the cut
edge of the mesentery to the parietal peritoneum; it is not necessary to
close the lateral gutter.
• Close and cover the abdominal incision.
• Excise the staple line on the small-bowel end.
• Insert 3/0 Monocryl sutures through the skin edge, the adjacent
seromuscular wall of the ileum (6cm proximal to distal end) and full
thickness of the open bowel end at three or four levels, avoiding the
vessels of the mesentery.
• Clip the sutures long and tie them once all have been inserted. This
everts the bowel end and results in a 3cm spout (eversion manoeuvre)
Loop ileostomy
Indication
To divert faecal stream or protect large bowel anastomosis or ileal pouch
anal anastomosis.

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Select a loop of terminal ileum close to the ileo-caecal junction. This
should be of sufficient length to be brought out without tension.
• Mark the distal limb with a suture.
• Deliver the loop through a trephine incision, as described in
‘Ileostomy—formation and closure’ (p. [link]).
• Close and cover the abdominal incision.
• Make a transverse enterotomy in the distal limb at the junction with
the skin using a diathermy point.
• Insert three 3/0 Monocryl sutures through the superior skin edge,
adjacent to seromuscular wall of the ileum and full thickness of the
open proximal bowel end.
• On the distal limb open end, insert a further four interrupted 4/0
Vicryl sutures through full thickness of bowel and subcuticular skin
so that the distal lumen is flush with the skin.
• Tie the sutures after all of them are in place. This forms a spout and
avoids forceful grasping of the mucosa with forceps to evert the bowel.
• Put extra sutures from open end of ileum to skin edge, as required. A
gentle push with a Langenbeck retractor on the serosal side helps to
form a spout.
