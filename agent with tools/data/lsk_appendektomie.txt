Laparoscopic appendicectomy

Procedure
• WHO checklist.
• Empty bladder before commencing the operation.
• Make a vertical skin incision within the umbilicus. Expose the linea
alba. Place two anchoring fascial sutures and incise the linea alba
between them.
• Open peritoneum and insert blunt trocar.
• Create pneumoperitoneum.
• Under laparoscopic vision, place a 10mm and 5mm port in the left
iliac fossa and suprapubic area, respectively, avoiding the inferior
epigastric vessels.
• Have the table tilted head-down and right-side up.
• Expose the appendix by displacing the ileum and caecum using
atraumatic grasping forceps.
• Ligate or clip the meso-appendix and its artery.
• Apply two ligatures at the base of the appendix and transect the
appendix between them. There is no need to bury the stump of the
appendix.
• Visualization of the Fallopian tubes and ovaries is aided by
manipulating the uterus with fingers placed in vaginal fornices.
• The appendix is removed through the 10mm cannula or by placing it
in an endo bag, if bulky/friable.
• Lavage with normal saline.
• Remove carbon dioxide and take out the ports.
• Close fascia of 10mm port sites.
• Use steristrips to approximate skin.
• Infiltrate wounds with local anaesthetic.

Tips and tricks
• Re-examine the abdomen under anaesthesia, plan your operation and
incision accordingly.
• Do not hesitate to extend the incision or convert from laparoscopic to
open procedure, if the anatomy is not clear or no progress in
operation.
• If appendix is normal, always look for other pathology.
