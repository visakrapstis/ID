Anal Abszess

Overview
Anorectal infection is usually linked to anal gland infection and is
commonly associated with a fistula. Anorectal infection may also be seen
in association with Crohn’s disease, hydradenitis suppurative, and
malignancy. Patients with peri-anal abscesses present with pain and a
palpable tender lump at the anal margin. Those with an ischiorectal
abscess have tenderness, induration, and fullness in the ischiorectal
fossa. An inter-sphincteric or submucous abscess should be suspected in
a patient with persistent anal pain and no obvious peri-anal abnormality

Procedure
The procedure is performed under general anaesthetic.
• WHO checklist.
• Make a cruciate incision over the swelling and deepen it to the
abscess cavity.
• Take a swab for bacteriology.
• Gently break down the fibrous septa in the ischiorectal fossa.
• Remove the corners of the incisions so that free drainage is provided
and the final opening represents the entire floor of the abscess cavity.
• Loosely pack the cavity with an alginate dressing.
• Do not attempt to probe for a fistula tract or to lay it open.
Aftercare with loose packing and dressing ensures that healing occurs
from deep to superficial, and lessens risk of a further abscess.

Tips and tricks
• Adequate/generous drainage is very important
• Do not probe the abscess cavity with force, this will result in a false
tract.
