Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair
• Select port placement (10mm camera port and 2 × 5mm ports)—
dependent on site of hernia.
• Establish pneumoperitoneum as for diagnostic laparoscopy.
• Inspect hernia; divide adhesions, as necessary; reduce contents;
clear a 4–6cm rim 360° around the defect.
• Reduce the intra-abdominal pressure to 6–8mmHg to reduce the
tension on the abdominal wall to size the dual-sided mesh
(polypropylene/ePTFE).
• Insert four long needles at 3, 6, 9, and 12 o’clock under direct vision
to mark the defect. Measure an overlap of 4–6cm accordingly and cut
the mesh.
• Place four 00 non-absorbable sutures on the mesh. 
Roll the mesh up (ePTFE surface inside). Place inside the
abdominal cavity (via the 10mm port).
• Place the mesh. At the previously marked skin
point, incise the skin to allow the passage of a suture hook. Grasp the
first tail, bring it through and secure it with a clip. Using the same
hole in the skin, pierce the sheath again but 1cm away from the first
entry point and grasp the second tail and pull it through. This will
provide a 1cm bite of the sheath when you tie the suture. Clip this pair
of tails. Repeat this manoeuvre for the anchoring sutures in positions
3, 6, 9, and 12. Tie.
• Use an endoscopic tacker to seal the perimeter of the repair, each
placed 1cm apart.
• Take ports out under direct vision, ensure haemostasis, and close
10mm port site sheath with J-PDS® #1; skin absorbable 3.0.

Tips and tricks
• For umbilical/paraumbilical hernias—it may be necessary to detach
the umbilical stalk from the rectus. Remember to reattach it at the end
(2.0 Vicryl®).
• Be vigilant for bowel loops within omentum/hernias!
• Chronic hernias—when opening the sac do not do it right at the top—
chronically stuck contents will be fused there, go a little further down
either side of the apex, there will be less chance of accidental injury to
contents.
