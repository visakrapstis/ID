Anatomy
The inguinal canal
• Extends from deep ring (defect in transversalis fascia, TF) to
superficial ring (fibres of external oblique, EO).
• Anterior wall: aponeurosis of EO, reinforced laterally by internal
oblique (IO) muscle.
• Posterior wall: TF.
• Roof: TF, IO, and transversus abdominis (TA) muscle.
• Floor: inguinal ligament and thickened medially by the lacunar
ligament.
• Contents: male—spermatic cord; female—round ligament.
• Nerves: ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genital branch of the
genitofemoral nerve—damage to these nerves will result in loss of
sensation over the lateral skin of the thigh, the groin, scrotum, or
labia.

Indications
• Asymptomatic hernia—majority will develop pain; a number will
require emergency repair.
• Symptomatic hernia (elective repair).
• Incarcerated hernia (emergency repair).

Procedure—open repair (Lichtenstein)
• Identify the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) and the pubic
tubercule (PT). The deep ring: midpoint of these, ˜2cm above the
inguinal ligament. Skin incision—transverse/curved lateral to the deep
ring to just above PT.
• Skin → subcutaneous fat/fascia: ensure haemostasis—tie any sizeable
veins 2.0 Vicryl®. Expose external oblique. Note the superficial ring.
• Open external oblique fascia in line with its fibres. Note the ilioinguinal nerve—protect it.
• Clear the leaves of EO fascia superiorly (note IO) and inferiorly (note
the inguinal ligament). Indirect sac present?
• Place your index finger on the PT; work around the back of the
spermatic cord—protect in hernia ring.
• Divide the cremasteric fibres to expose the indirect hernia sac; hold
its edge with a small clip. Dissect it free.
• Open the sac—inspect/reduce contents if viable; insert a finger, twist
medially to determine if there is a direct sac.
• Twist the sac to obliterate it; place a transfixion stitch (2.0 Vicryl®)
through it; amputate the excess; reduce it.

Direct hernia—inspect the posterior wall (TF)
• The sac may be opened, its contents reduced, and excess sac
excised. For small hernia/apparent weakness, the bulge is reduced
whilst the posterior wall is reconstructed.
• Use a continuous non-absorbable 2.0 suture, from PT to the level of
the deep ring, approximating the TF just above the inguinal ligament
to that below the conjoint tendon.
• The resultant deep ring should be snug around the cord.
• Polypropylene mesh: cut, place, and secure it as shown—
continuous 2.0 non-absorbable suture.

Closure
• EO fascia: continuous absorbable (#1).
• Scarpa’s fascia: interrupted absorbable sutures (2.0).
• Skin: continuous subcuticular absorbable sutures (3.0).

Complications (specific to the procedure)
• Superficial wound infection <5%.
• Recurrence of hernia 3%.
• Haematoma 2%.
• Chronic pain 1–2%.
• Testicular ischaemia <1%.
• Urinary retention.

Tips and tricks
• Ensure a good hold for your first medial stitch overlying, but not
through, the PT as most recurrences are medial
• Careful not to drift up too high on the inguinal ligament when taking
the bites for your continuous suture on the mesh as you will steal
length from your EO fascia making it harder to close at the end of the
procedure!
